## 🚀 Getting Started

**Recommended Path**: Start with `single_modality_demo.py` to understand the incremental approach, then explore `mock_hardware_framework.py` for development flexibility, and progress through the performance and clinical validation demos.

**Key Philosophy**: **Focus on execution over ambition.** Build incrementally, validate continuously, and scale based on proven success.

*The future of brain-computer interfaces lies not in attempting everything at once, but in methodical, validated progress toward specific, achievable goals.*
