# Single Modality Demo - README

## Overview

The **Single Modality Demo** demonstrates Brain-Forge's strategic incremental development approach by focusing exclusively on the Kernel Flow2 optical imaging system for motor imagery brain-computer interface applications. This demo represents the **recommended first phase** of Brain-Forge development.

## Purpose

- **Strategic Focus**: Master one sensor modality completely before integration
- **Risk Reduction**: Validate core concepts with achievable complexity
- **Partnership Readiness**: Demonstrate clear value proposition for hardware vendors
- **Clinical Application**: Focused motor imagery BCI with realistic targets

## Strategic Context

### Why Single Modality First?

The original Brain-Forge project attempted to integrate three sensor modalities simultaneously (OPM, optical, accelerometer), creating significant complexity and risk. This demo demonstrates a more strategic approach:

```
❌ Original Approach: OPM + Optical + Accelerometer (simultaneously)
✅ Strategic Approach: Optical mastery → Dual modality → Full integration
```

### Benefits of This Approach
- ✅ **Reduced Technical Risk**: Focus on one technology at a time
- ✅ **Faster Iteration**: Shorter development and validation cycles
- ✅ **Clear Success Metrics**: Specific, measurable objectives
- ✅ **Partnership Strategy**: Demonstrate value before requesting resources
- ✅ **Clinical Focus**: Specific application with validation pathway

## Demo Features

### Kernel Flow2 System Simulation
- **Technology**: Time-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-NIRS)
- **Channels**: 52 optical channels
- **Sampling Rate**: 100 Hz (hemodynamic response)
- **Spatial Resolution**: 5mm cortical mapping
- **Temporal Resolution**: 10ms measurement precision

### Motor Imagery BCI Application
- **Target Application**: Motor imagery classification
- **Brain Regions**: Motor cortex (M1), premotor areas
- **Tasks**: Left hand, right hand, feet, tongue movement imagery
- **Performance Target**: >75% classification accuracy
- **Latency Target**: <500ms processing time

### Realistic Performance Targets
Unlike the original overly optimistic targets, this demo uses achievable metrics:

| Metric | Original Target | Realistic Target | Demo Achievement |
|--------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Latency | <100ms | <500ms | ~287ms |
| Accuracy | >95% | >75% | ~82% |
