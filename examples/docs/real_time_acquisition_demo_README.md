## Troubleshooting

### Common Acquisition Issues

1. **Poor Signal Quality**
   ```
   SignalQualityError: SNR below 15 dB on multiple channels
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Check sensor positioning and scalp contact
   - Verify environmental shielding effectiveness
   - Inspect cable connections and integrity
   - Recalibrate sensors and amplifiers

2. **Synchronization Problems**
   ```
   SyncError: Multi-modal timing drift >2ms
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Verify hardware clock synchronization
   - Check trigger signal connectivity
   - Restart synchronization subsystem
   - Validate network time protocol (NTP) sync

3. **Streaming Latency Issues**
   ```
   StreamingError: WebSocket latency >100ms
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Check network bandwidth and congestion
   - Optimize data compression settings
   - Reduce streaming client load
   - Implement edge caching for remote clients

4. **Hardware Communication Failures**
   ```
   HardwareError: Unable to communicate with OMP array
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Check hardware power and connectivity
   - Restart hardware interface drivers
   - Verify USB/Ethernet cable connections
   - Run hardware diagnostic tests
