## Troubleshooting

### Common Simulation Issues

1. **Model Convergence Problems**
   ```
   SimulationError: Neural dynamics model failed to converge
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Adjust integration time step (reduce from 0.1ms)
   - Check model parameter ranges for stability
   - Verify connectivity matrix conditioning
   - Use adaptive solvers for stiff equations

2. **Real-Time Synchronization Failures**
