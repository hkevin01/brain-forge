## Troubleshooting

### Common Visualization Issues

1. **Poor Rendering Performance**
   ```
   PerformanceError: Frame rate <30 FPS
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Reduce mesh resolution or level of detail
   - Check GPU driver compatibility and updates
   - Optimize shader complexity and texture sizes
   - Enable hardware acceleration and GPU memory management

2. **Real-Time Latency Issues**
   ```
   LatencyError: Visualization lag >100ms
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Optimize data streaming pipeline and buffering
   - Reduce network latency to data sources
   - Implement predictive rendering and caching
   - Use GPU compute shaders for parallel processing

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Problems**
   ```
   CompatibilityError: Features missing on mobile platform
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Implement platform-specific optimization
   - Use progressive enhancement for feature support
   - Provide fallback rendering modes
   - Test thoroughly on target platforms

4. **Memory Usage Issues**
   ```
   MemoryError: GPU memory exhaustion
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Implement efficient memory management and pooling
   - Use texture compression and mesh optimization
   - Enable level-of-detail rendering
   - Stream data progressively rather than loading all at once
