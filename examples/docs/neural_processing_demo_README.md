## Troubleshooting

### Common Neural Processing Issues

1. **Poor Signal Quality**
   ```
   SignalQualityError: SNR below 15 dB threshold
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Check sensor positioning and calibration
   - Verify environmental shielding effectiveness
   - Adjust preprocessing filter parameters
   - Consider additional artifact removal steps

2. **Artifact Removal Failures**
   ```
   ArtifactError: Unable to remove cardiac artifacts
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Increase ICA component number
   - Try alternative artifact removal methods
   - Verify ECG reference signal quality
   - Adjust artifact detection thresholds

3. **Feature Extraction Issues**
   ```
   FeatureError: Spectral analysis produces NaN values
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Check for data discontinuities or gaps
   - Verify sampling rate consistency
   - Adjust spectral analysis parameters
   - Use robust statistical methods

4. **AI Model Performance Degradation**
   ```
   ModelError: Classification accuracy <90%
   ```
   **Solutions**:
   - Retrain model with additional data
   - Adjust model hyperparameters
   - Verify input data preprocessing
   - Check for data distribution shifts
