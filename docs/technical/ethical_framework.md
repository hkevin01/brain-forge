## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Neural Privacy and Mental Integrity

#### Fundamental Rights
- **Mental Privacy**: The right to keep one's thoughts, memories, and neural patterns private
- **Cognitive Liberty**: The freedom to control one's own mental processes and cognitive enhancement
- **Neural Self-Determination**: The right to make informed decisions about brain data collection and use

#### Implementation Guidelines
```python
# Privacy protection in Brain-Forge
class NeuralPrivacyProtection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.encryption_level = 'military_grade'
        self.data_anonymization = True
        self.local_processing_only = True
        
    def protect_neural_data(self, brain_data):
        """Implement comprehensive privacy protection"""
        # End-to-end encryption
        encrypted_data = self.encrypt_neural_patterns(brain_data)
        
        # Differential privacy
        private_data = self.add_differential_privacy(encrypted_data)
        
        # Local processing to prevent data leakage
        processed_data = self.local_only_processing(private_data)
        
        return processed_data
```
