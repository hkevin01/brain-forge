## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.9.x to 1.0.0

**Breaking Changes**:
- Configuration file format updated to YAML
- API endpoints restructured under `/api/v1/`
- Hardware device initialization requires new configuration format

**Migration Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Backup existing configuration
cp config/config.json config/config.json.backup

# 2. Convert configuration to YAML format
python scripts/migrate_config.py config/config.json config/config.yaml

# 3. Update API calls
# Old: GET /status
# New: GET /api/v1/status

# 4. Update hardware initialization
# See INSTALLATION.md for new hardware configuration format
```

### Upgrading from 0.8.x to 0.9.0

**Breaking Changes**:
- WebSocket message format changed
- Visualization API restructured

**Migration Steps**:
```bash
# Update WebSocket client code
# Old message format: {"type": "data", "payload": {...}}
# New message format: {"type": "data", "stream": "raw_data", "data": {...}}

# Update visualization calls
# Old: viz.plot_brain(data)
# New: viz.plot_activity(data, brain_model="fsaverage")
```

## Deprecation Notices

### Deprecated in 1.0.0
- `brain_forge.legacy.old_api`: Use `brain_forge.api` instead
- `BrainForge.start_legacy_mode()`: Use standard initialization
- Configuration in JSON format: Use YAML format instead

### Removed in 1.0.0
- Python 3.8 support (end of life)
- Legacy hardware interfaces
- Old WebSocket protocol (v1)

## Known Issues

### Current Issues (1.0.0)
- **MacOS**: OpenGL compatibility issues with older hardware (workaround: use software rendering)
- **Windows**: USB device detection may require manual driver installation
- **Linux**: Some distributions require additional OpenGL libraries

### Planned Fixes
