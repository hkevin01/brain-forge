--- COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNICATION LOG ---

Initial session started. Task received: "examine what is not implemented, incomplete and in development and start work on those parts; after working on that update docs file with current implementation percentages and completed"

Beginning comprehensive examination of Brain-Forge project to identify incomplete and in-development components. Will analyze entire codebase, documentation, and infrastructure to determine implementation status.

Starting with examination of source code directory structure and core modules to assess completion levels.
