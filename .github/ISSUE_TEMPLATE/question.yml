      placeholder: |
        I'm trying to set up real-time MEG connectivity analysis for a neurofeedback experiment. I have a 306-channel OMP system and need to compute phase-locking value (PLV) in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) with less than 50ms latency. 
        
        What's the recommended approach for:
        1. Setting up the real-time data stream
        2. Configuring the connectivity analysis parameters
        3. Handling the results for neurofeedback display
        
        I've read the connectivity documentation but I'm unsure about the best practices for low-latency real-time analysis.

      placeholder: |
        I've tried:
        1. Following the basic connectivity tutorial - it works but too slow for real-time
        2. Looking at the real-time processing examples - but they don't cover connectivity
        3. Reading about PLV algorithms - understand the theory but not sure about implementation
        4. Testing with smaller datasets - works fine but need to scale to full 306 channels
        
        I haven't yet tried:
        - GPU acceleration options
        - Custom connectivity algorithms
        - Different real-time buffering strategies
