      description: Detailed description of the documentation problem
      placeholder: |
        The documentation for RealTimeConnectivity class doesn't explain how to set up the callback function for handling results. The example shows `rt_analyzer.on_result(callback_function)` but doesn't define what the callback function should look like or what parameters it receives.
