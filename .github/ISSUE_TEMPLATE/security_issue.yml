        **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è**
        
        Thank you for helping keep Brain-Forge secure! Security issues require special handling to protect users and data.
        
        **FOR CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:**
        - Please email security@brain-forge.org directly instead of using this public issue tracker
        - Do not disclose details publicly until a fix is available
        - We aim to respond to security reports within 24 hours
        
        **This form is for:**
        - Security improvements and hardening suggestions
        - Non-critical security concerns
        - Security questions about Brain-Forge practices
        - Privacy-related issues
        
        **Medical Data Protection:** Brain-Forge handles sensitive neuroscience data. Security issues may affect patient privacy and research data integrity.
