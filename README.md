# Brain-Forge: Advanced Brain Scanning and Simulation Platform

A comprehensive toolkit for multi-modal brain data acquisition, processing, mapping, and digital brain simulation.

## Overview

Brain-Forge is an advanced neuroscience platform that bridges the gap between real-time brain data acquisition and sophisticated neural simulation. The system integrates multiple brain scanning technologies including OPM helmets, Kernel optical helmets, and accelerometers to create detailed brain maps and enable transfer learning between biological and artificial neural networks.

## Key Features

- **Multi-modal Brain Data Acquisition**: Support for OPM (Optically Pumped Magnetometer) helmets, Kernel optical helmets, and accelerometer arrays
- **Real-time Processing**: High-performance signal processing with GPU acceleration
- **Advanced Brain Mapping**: Spatial and functional network analysis with connectivity modeling
- **Neural Simulation**: Brian2 and NEST-based neural network simulation with plasticity modeling
- **Transfer Learning**: Pattern extraction and neural encoding for brain-to-AI knowledge transfer
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time 3D brain visualization and network graphs
- **Hardware Integration**: Comprehensive device driver support and calibration systems

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- Git

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-forge.git
cd brain-forge
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```

### Development Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

## Usage

### Basic Brain Data Acquisition

```python
from brain_forge import StreamManager, Config

# Initialize configuration
config = Config.load('configs/default.yaml')

# Start data acquisition
stream_manager = StreamManager(config)
stream_manager.start_acquisition()
```

### Neural Simulation

```python
from brain_forge.simulation import BrainSimulator

# Create brain simulation
simulator = BrainSimulator()
simulator.load_brain_model('data/brain_atlases/default.nii')
simulator.run_simulation(duration=1000)
```

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core**: Configuration, logging, and exception handling
- **Acquisition**: Device interfaces and data streaming
- **Processing**: Signal analysis and feature extraction
- **Mapping**: Brain atlas integration and connectivity analysis
- **Simulation**: Neural network modeling and dynamics
- **Transfer**: Pattern extraction and neural encoding
- **Visualization**: Real-time plotting and 3D brain viewing
- **API**: REST API, WebSocket server, and CLI tools
